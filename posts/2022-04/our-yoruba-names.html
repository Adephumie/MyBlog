        <p>
          Hello all, after I took an introductory class for HTML/CSS, I started
          looking for projects to work on. At this point I had taken my AWS
          cloud practitioner exam and had also been certified. While looking for
          projects that will help me have hands-on practice of what I'd read
          about, I found the cloud resume challenge. I decided to do it because
          I will have to <br />use many skills to achieve the end result.<br /><br />
          Having worked as a freelance content writer, all I did before now was
          to develop contents and deliver to clients. I didn't know what it
          entailed to upload those contents online. So, this gave me the perfect
          opportunity to merge all my skills to create this beautiful and
          functional piece. Please, Enjoy!
        </p>

          As a Nigerian from the Yoruba ethnic group living in the abroad, I
          thought of putting out our yoruba names and their meanings. This will
          help me, my husband, and the kids to remember these meanings when
          asked. We meet people of diverse cultures, nationalities, and races
          and the first thing they want to know is our name followed by the
          meaning. When I was in Nigeria, I never had the need to actively know
          the meaning of my name. So that question always caught me off-guard.
          But with this blogpost, I'd have been able to achieve this aim.<br /><br />
          Yorubas have a culture where the names given have powerful meanings.
          Many things depict the Yoruba culture and our names are usually a
          combination of two or more of these words: Oluwa (God), Ade (Crown),
          Ola (Wealth), Ayo (Joy), Olu (God), Iyi (Honor), Ire (Goodness), Omo
          (Child) etc. We are a family of four and I have picked our names to
          elaborate on their meanings.
