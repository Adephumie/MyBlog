          My name is Funmilayo A. Fagoyinbo, my tech journey started passively
          in 2020, and towards the end of 2021, I became active in my pursuit of
          becoming a DevOps/Cloud Engineer. I bagged my Bachelor of Science
          degree in Chemistry from Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Osun
          state, in 2012. And months after I completed my NYSC (a program set up
          by the Nigerian government for graduates), I started my career as a
          Medical Sales Representative in the Pharmaceutical Industry in
          Nigeria. I gained some valuable and transferable skills being a Med
          Rep and some of them include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Excellent communication skills with customers- knowing that they are
            the lifeline of the business.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ability to use my initiative when dealing with customers,
            colleagues, and managers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Great attention to detail and ensuring my bookkeeping and accounts
            are up to date.
          </li>
          <li>
            Commitment to planning: This entails planning my itinerary for the
            week and month thereby helping me manage my activities in my
            assigned region.
          </li>
          <li>
            Team Effort: I also learnt to follow up with work and collaborate
            with my team which included colleagues and managers to ensure the
            success of our short and long term goals.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Aside from my profession as a Medical Sales Rep., I am also a
          Creative- a Fashion Designer. While I was an undergraduate and did not
          have any sewing skills, I would create a mental picture of my look,
          sketch it, and give it to a tailor to make for me. So, after I
          completed my NYSC program and could not get any job placement, I
          decided to start my fashion designing education and I enrolled in a
          fashion school. I enjoyed the creativity in the process of garment
          making that entailed designing, sketching, and sewing. The part of the
          course I was most excited about was the pattern drafting aspect that
          entailed measurements, mathematical conversions, and construction
          (taking me back to my technical drawing and building construction
          background). I have always loved delving into technical things and
          that was what made the pattern drafting aspect of the fashion design
          more appealing to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would sketch out designs, proceed to make patterns for the clothes,
          cut them out, and use them to construct beautiful garments for
          clients. Due to my love for business and a desire to provide
          solutions, I started making beddings such as pillowcases, bedspreads,
          and duvets based on orders. I also made and sold beddings for babies
          and older children. I was also able to add more skills to myself
          (handling my business and its intricacies). I had to learn to meet up
          with deadlines, multitask, and as my career as a Med. Rep. began, I
          learnt to prioritize.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, according to two of my best quotes, “Life is a journey, not a
          destination” and “Learning is a constant process of discovery- a
          process without end”, I knew I wanted more for myself. I wanted an
          opportunity that would challenge me, show me that I could set goals
          and meet them, and ultimately, something I could grow into. I loved
          challenges, was not afraid if it had to do with mathematics or
          calculation, loved the idea of contributing to the advancement of
          projects, and then, an opportunity came- I relocated with my family.
        </p>
        <p>
          The relocation made it possible for me to start on a fresh page, and
          as a wife and mum of two, I knew I wanted to switch to a career that
          would create a good work-life balance. Also, after the Covid-19
          pandemic, remote and hybrid work became a thing. So, it was a perfect
          switch that would also bring together all the experiences and skills I
          had gathered over the years. This gave me the clarity I needed on what
          new challenge I could take on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another major reason why I wanted to take on this new challenge and
          see myself succeed is because of my children, especially my daughter.
          Years from now, I want her to see a figure she can relate to. I want
          to be able to tell her that she can aim for the stars and be anything
          she aspires to be. I do not want to be in a position where I would
          tell her she could be anything she wanted to be and then she would ask
          if I was able to achieve my dreams, and I would say, "No". I want her
          to be proud to call me her role model.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, No, I do not have everything figured out yet, but I know it is the
          beginning of many greater things to come. I am looking forward to
          celebrating 5, 10, 15, and more years of working as an Engineer. I
          recently took my AWS Cloud Practitioner certification exam and I
          passed ( I was so excited, I still am). I am learning more about Front
          End Development, Python, Linux, etc. This journey has taught me a lot;
          some of whicheer are to be grateful and celebrate the little wins that
          will eventually become the bigger things. I am so excited about what
          the future holds and I am looking forward to its unfolding. Thank you.
